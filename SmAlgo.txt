Problem schema: 
----------------
- CreationDate
- Type (new, learning, relearning, review)
- Interval (90 days. This is used in various calculations, and ultimately is used to decide the problem's next due date)
- Ease (2.5. Default is StartingEase. The following descriptions apply to Review problems only, as New, Learning, and Relearning problems dont use Ease at all. When the user presses "good", Interval becomes: Interval*Ease*IntervalModifier*fuzz, where fuzz randomizes it a few percentage points. If the user presses "easy", then Interval becomes: Interval*Ease*IntervalModifier*fuzz*EasyBonus AND Ease becomes: Ease+15%. If user presses "hard", then Interval becomes: Interval*1.2 AND Ease becomes: Ease-15%. If user presses "again", this Review card becomes a Relearning card, treated the exact same as a learning card except it uses RelearnSteps and RelearnGraduatingInterval, and also Ease becomes: Ease-20%)
- DueDate 







User schema: 
---------------
- LearnSteps (10 1d. means, when user presses "good", it will show in 1 day, then "good" again, it graduates out of learning and into Review type, into GraduatingInterval. Any time they press "Again", it goes back to first step, in this case 10 min, and they have to go through steps all again. Pressing "Easy" skips all steps and goes to EasyInterval. Pressing anything turns the New problem into a Learning problem, forever until it graduates)
- RelearnSteps (10. Means, for a Relearning problem, it will be shown step 1 in 10 min, then pressing "good" will graduate it back to a Review problem into RelearnGraduatingInterval)
- RelearnGraduatingInterval (0.75. Means, when a relearn problem graduates, its interval becomes 75% of its current interval, which is the interval it had before it relapsed)
- GraduatingInterval (3. Means, after a learning type problem goes through all the steps normally, with user pressing "good" the required amound of times, the problem becomes Review type and will be shown again after GraduatingInterval amount of days)
- EasyInterval (4. Means, after pressing "easy" at any step for a learning problem, skips all the rest of the steps and then the next time the problem is shown is EasyInterval days)
- StartingEase (2.5. Means, this is what every problem's Ease starts at)
- MinimumEase (1.3. Means, Ease of every problem card can never go below 1.3)
- EasyBonus (1.3. Means, when a user presses "easy" on a review card, this bonus is implemented in the Interval calculation as well to make it bigger)
- IntervalModifier (1. This is part of the Interval & Ease calcualtion, so by changing it, you can make Anki more or less aggressive)
- MaximumInterval (180d. This is the maximum that an interval for a problem can be. It will never increase past this, even if you keep pressing "good" or "easy")
- MaximumNewPerDay (9999. The maximum number of new problems that will be shown per day)
