                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">Repcode is a platform built to empower software engineers to excel in Leetcode-style technical interviews. It helps you achieve this in three main ways: </p>
                    <ol className="list-decimal text-secondary mb-8 ml-5 text-xl">
                        <li className="mb-4"><span className="font-bold">Organize, Catagorize, and Analyze:</span> The intuitive UI/UX makes it simple to organize and categorize problems. In addition, a detailed statistic breakdown of every problem you add to Repcode is available, helping you target your weaknesses and identify your strengths. You can also store notes and commented solutions with each problem, allowing you to refer back to them at any time for further review </li>
                        <li className="mb-4"><span className="font-bold">Spatial Repetition Review:</span> A built-in spatial repetition algorithm ensures you don&apos;t forget what you&apos;ve learned, intelligently scheduling reviews of past problems to reinforce your understanding</li>
                        <li><span className="font-bold">AI-Powered Feedback: </span> Integrated AI (trained on the problem and its optimal solution) provides instant feedback on your solutions, helping you identify mistakes and areas for improvement in real-time.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">We will expand on each of these features in more detail below. But first, let&apos;s clarify how Repcode is meant to be used and what it is not designed for. </p>
                </div>

                <div className="mb-24" id="what-repcode-is-not">
                    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-2 inline-block border-b-2 border-divide text-primary">What Repcode is not</h2>
                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">Repcode is not intended to replace Leetcode but rather to complement it. Think of Leetcode as your textbook and Repcode as your personalized notebook for problem-solving. Repcode helps you organize, review, and receive feedback on your work, making the learning process more structured and effective.  </p>

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">To master Leetcode, it&apos;s important to understand that simply tackling random problems without focus or strategy isn&apos;t the best approach. Technical interviews often test your grasp of key data structures and algorithms, so building a strong foundation is critical. For example, trying to solve complex backtracking or binary search problems before you fully understand arrays and two-pointer techniques isn&apos;t productive. Mastering Leetcode requires solving problems in patterns, progressing from fundamental concepts to more complex ones. Roadmaps like the <Link className="text-blue underline" href="https://neetcode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neetcode 150</Link> guide you through this process by organizing problems into patterns. Once you grasp the patterns, you&apos;re better equipped to solve a wide variety of new, unseen problems.</p>
                    <div className="flex flex-col items-center mb-8">
                        <img src="/guide/neetcode.png" alt="collections image" className="w-5/6 max-w-xl mb-2" />
                        <p className="text-secondary text-sm">The top part of the Neetcode 150 roadmap</p>
                    </div>

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">So then, where does Repcode factor in? Repcode provides a way to create <span className="font-bold">custom collections</span> to group problems by pattern or concept. For instance, if you&apos;re studying linked lists, you can create a collection called &quot;Linked Lists&quot; and store all your Leetcode problems, notes, and solutions for that pattern in one place. This allows you to easily revisit problems and review your thought processes.  </p>

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">Additionally, every problem you add to a collection is automatically included in <span className="font-bold">Study Mode</span>,  which leverages the spatial repetition algorithm. This ensures you review problems at the optimal time for retention, so you won&apos;t lose track of what you&apos;ve learned and reinforce your learning over time.</p>

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">To further enhance your study process, Repcode integrates with an <span className="font-bold">AI-Powered Assistant</span> that provides instant feedback when you&apos;re stuck on a solution, giving you helpful hints and corrections in real-time. </p>

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">In short, Repcode addresses three major challenges when it comes to mastering Leetcode: <span className="font-bold">Organization</span>, <span className="font-bold">Review</span>, and <span className="font-bold">Feedback</span> â€” all with the help of collections, Study Mode, and AI integration. </p>

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">The first part of this guide will cover how to use Repcode to effectively organize your Leetcode problems, and attach notes and solutions and stuff to them. As mentioned earlier, the best way to improve at Leetcode is to break down problems into patterns and focus on practicing within those specific patterns. Repcode makes this easy by allowing you to create collections.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">Each collection can hold multiple problems, and you can customize these collections as needed. For example, you can rename a collection at any time by clicking the pen and paper icon on the bottom left of the collection card. You can also delete a collection by clicking the trash icon next to it, but keep in mind that doing so will permanently delete all the problems within it, and this action cannot be undone.
                    </p>
                    <div className="flex flex-col items-center mb-8">

                    </div>
                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">
                    From the <span className="font-bold">dashboard view</span>, which shows all your collections, you can quickly access key information at a glance. This includes when the last problem was added to a collection, as well as a breakdown of the problems by type â€” categorized into <span className="font-bold">New</span>, <span className="font-bold">Learning</span>, and <span className="font-bold">Review</span> stages. The color bar at the bottom gives you an instant snapshot of your progress within each collection. The more green the bar, the better your understanding of that pattern, as it means more problems are in the Review stage, indicating strong familiarity. Note that if there is a red warning symbol next to the Last Updated date, it means it has been longer than a month since you last solved a new problem from that collection, so it&apos;s recommended you should try and solve a new one soon to keep your understanding fresh! Remember that it is important to tackle novel problems from time to time, in addition to reviewing old ones! 
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">
                        When creating a new problem in a collection, you will be prompted to fill out a form with all sorts of information about the problem. You can enter the Leetcode problem number and click Autofill to automatically scrape these details from Leetcode directly, or you can manually fill out the details yourself. These include:

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl">One of the unique aspects of Repcode is its ability to not only help you store and organize problems, but also review them efficiently through <span className="font-bold">Study Mode</span>, powered by a fully customizable spatial repetition algorithm. This algorithm, similar to the one used by Anki, ensures that you never forget what you&apos;ve learned by spacing out your review sessions. As of this writing, Repcode is the only actively maintained platform that offers this feature out of the box. </p>
                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl"><span className="font-bold">What is spatial repetition?</span> In short, it&apos;s a learning technique that schedules review sessions at increasing intervals to improve long-term retention. It&apos;s based on the idea that the brain retains information best when it&apos;s reviewed at strategic points, rather than in one sitting. Also, the algorithm is very smart, and will quickly determine what data structures and specific problems you struggle with, and which ones you find easier, and adjust itself accordingly so that you spend more time on problems that you have trouble with.

                    <p className="text-secondary mb-8 text-xl"><span className="font-bold">First, the easy part:</span> how to use it. The great thing about Study Mode is that it&apos;s largely <span className="font-bold">automatic</span> â€” the spatial repetition algorithm updates and manages itself. Whenever you add a problem to a collection, it&apos;s automatically included in Study Mode and factored into the algorithm. Your role is minimal: just navigate to the Study Mode section and, when you have problems due for review, a &quot;Study Now&quot; button will appear. Clicking this button will prompt you to solve the problems assigned for that day. </p>
