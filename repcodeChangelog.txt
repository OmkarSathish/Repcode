External dependencies: 
------------------------
- Firebase for Auth 
- AWS RDS to host the MySQL database 
- Formspree for emails 
- Vercel for deployment/analytics 


up next: 
---------------
- fix guide page 
- remove toasts or restyle them 
- new user pop up needs to be restyled 
- add Repcode vs. Leetcode vs. Neetcode comparison table in landing page 
- check open source stuff, mainly branch protection rules and can other githib accounts push to master? 
- quickly test every feature on an alt acc to make sure it's all working 
- AWS RDS upgrade (CPU i think to make it faster)
- AFTER LAUNCH: add open source GitHub link somewhere in landing page 

- Bug: for new users, Total Problems says 3 but should say 1 
- "generate solution using AI" button 
- the update endpoints need to be more secure 



All:
------------
- bug: issue with, deleting collection doesn't invalidate cache to refetch duetoday problems 
- bug: the study mode graph is still shown when the page is loading 
- bug: timezone issue with heatmap. sometimes it updates the next day, not today 
- add a paint canvas in problems to whiteboard 
- add problem tags (like strings, binary search, heap, etc. Select from a dropdown menu) 
- user setting to hide problem name, and hide problem type 
- filters (checkboxes) for problem difficulty and type 
- Review problems need to be dispersed more: the fuzz factor doesn't seem to do anything. All 'Good' on newly added Reveiw problems are 7 days, and 'New' is 9 days. There should always be += a day or two to spread these out 
- rate limiting for API calls so peeps cant troll with Postman. Although, most endpoints are now authenticated so this may not be needed anymore. ig see which endpoints aren't authenticated and see if we need rate limiting for them
