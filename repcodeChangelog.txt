All:
------------
- bug: issue with, deleting collection doesn't invalidate cache to refetch duetoday problems 
- bug: timezone issue with heatmap. sometimes it updates the next day, not today 
- add problem tags (like strings, binary search, heap, etc. Select from a dropdown menu) 
- user setting to hide problem name, and hide problem type 
- filters (checkboxes) for problem difficulty and type 
- Review problems need to be dispersed more: the fuzz factor doesn't seem to do anything. All 'Good' on newly added Reveiw problems are 7 days, and 'New' is 9 days. There should always be += a day or two to spread these out
